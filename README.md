1.Project Introduction
With the development of microwave photonic technology, people have higher requirements for high bandwidth and low power consumption, and Photonic Integrated Circuit technology gradually emerges. In optoelectronic integrated chips, electro-optic modulator is the most important device, so it is very necessary to optimize its design. Because of the excellent electro-optic performance and high temperature stability of lithium niobate material, it is beneficial to prepare electro-optic modulator with low drive voltage and large bandwidth.\citep{2002Driver}The study of electro-optic modulator in this project starts from theoretical analysis. After establishing theoretical model, design and modeling of silicon-based lithium niobate electro-optic modulator is carried out to test its main technical indicators and improve it.
2.My Plan
The design of lithium niobate modulator is as follows: silicon substrate layer, silicon dioxide isolation layer, lithium niobate layer, silicon dioxide buffer layer. After modeling it in the simulation software, we design its end face and impedance matching work.Then the theoretical model of attenuation coefficient and impedance and modulator bandwidth is established. Data processing and modeling are carried out in MATLAB software, and obtain the simulation results
3.Conclusion
In this paper, the electrode size of the silon-based lithium niobate modulator is simulated, and the corresponding optimal bandwidth is obtained, which will be further optimized in the future.
